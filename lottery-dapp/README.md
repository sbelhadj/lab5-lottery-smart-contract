# Ethereum Lottery DApp

## Overview

This tutorial walks you through building a **Lottery DApp** using:

- **Solidity** for the smart contract
- **React.js** for the frontend
- **Ethers.js** for blockchain interaction
- **Hardhat** for smart contract deployment
- **React Toastify** for real-time event notifications

In this DApp:
- Users can **join the lottery** by sending 0.01 ETH
- Only the **manager** (deployer) can **pick the winner**
- **Real-time notifications** will notify users when events like new players joining or a winner being selected occur.
